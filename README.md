## CC09:Stack
Definition: A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. You can only access the most recently added item. It supports operations:
1. push: Add an item to the top.
2. pop: Remove and return the top item.
3. peek: Return the top item without removing it.
4. isEmpty: Check if the stack is empty.

## CC09:Queue
Definition: A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. Elements are added at the back and removed from the front. It supports the following operations:
1. Enqueue: Add an item to the back of the queue.
2. Dequeue: Remove and return the item from the front of the queue.
3. Peek: Return the item at the front without removing it.
4. IsEmpty: Check if the queue is empty.

## CC17:Linked List - Rotate by K
Given a singly linked list and an integer k, rotate the linked list to the left by k places.
After rotating, the node which was originally at position k will now become the head of the list, and the remaining nodes will follow.

## CC18:PrintRightView
Given a binary tree, implement a method PrintRightView() that prints the right

the rightmost node at each level, when viewed from the right side.   

## CC19:LevelWithMaxNodes
Given a binary tree, write a function to find the level that contains the maximum number of nodes.
