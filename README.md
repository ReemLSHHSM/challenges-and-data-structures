CCB:Most Frequent Number
a method that takes an integer array and returns the number that appears the most times. If there are no duplicates, it returns the first number in the array. If more than one number shows up the same number of times, it returns the first found.

## Challenge 03: Remove Middle Value from Array  
A function called RemoveMiddleValue that takes in an array as its parameter.It should remove the value at the middle index of the array if the array length is odd, or the middle two values if the array length is even, and return the modified array.

## Challenge 05: Find Duplicates in Array 
Write a function called FindDuplicates that accepts an array as its parameter. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods provided by the language, the function should return an array of duplicate values.

## Challenge 06: Common-Elements 
Write a function called CommonElements that accepts two arrays of integers as its parameters. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods, the function should return a new array containing the common elements between the two input arrays.

## Challenge 06-B: Reverse Words 
Write a function called ReverseWords that accepts a string as its parameter. The function should reverse the order of the words in the string and return the resulting string. Words are defined as sequences of characters separated by spaces.
